1.Start

2.Read the number of frames (fCount) and the reference string (pages).Initialize arrays (frames, time) and variables (i, j, k, pos, flag, faultCount, counter, queue)

3.Initialize frames array with null values.Initialize counters (counter, queue, faultCount)   
   tp 0.

4.Iterate through the pages in the reference string (i):
4.1Set flag to 0.
4.2Check if the page is already present in frames:
1.If yes, mark a hit, update the occurrence time, and continue to the next page.
4.3If the page is not present:
1.Check if there is free space in frames (queue < fCount):
1.If yes, add the page to frames, update the occurrence time, and increment the queue.
2.If frames are full (queue == fCount):
1.Find the LRU page in frames (least recently used) using the findLRU function.
2.Replace the LRU page with the current page, update the occurrence time.
4.4Print the current state of frames.



5.Print the total number of page faults (faultCount).

6. End
